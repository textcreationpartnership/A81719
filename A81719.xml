            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <l>Then ſtreight they rays'd an Army, and did call</l>
               <l>The cruel <hi>Ram,</hi> to be their Generall;</l>
               <l>Who ſoon ſet forward with a mighty force,</l>
               <l>Both Waggons, Guns, great ſtore of foot &amp; horſe,</l>
               <l>At which came in all Beaſts both near and far,</l>
               <l>With Bowls, Rings, Bodkins to maintain the War,</l>
               <l>Except the harmleſs <hi>Lambkius,</hi> who did creep</l>
               <l>To the <hi>Lyon,</hi> who might in ſafety keep</l>
               <l>Them from the <hi>Wolf,</hi> and all thoſe Rebels who</l>
               <l>Did ſeek to kill them and their Sov'reign too.</l>
               <l>He told them that their lives he would defend</l>
               <l>Againſt their foes, though he his blood did ſpend.</l>
               <l>At laſt theſe Rebels plac'd in battel Ray,</l>
               <l>Did from the <hi>Lyon</hi> win that fatal day</l>
               <l>Wherein he fled, the <hi>Lambs</hi> they follow'd after,</l>
               <l>And many thouſands there was left to ſlaughter.</l>
               <l>Thus did the <hi>Lyon</hi> from theſe Rebels fly,</l>
               <l>Who would have ſpilt the blood of's Majeſty.</l>
               <l>Suppoſing that to friends he ſafe had paſt,</l>
               <l>But they prov'd foes, and ſold him at the laſt</l>
               <l>For curſed Gold, ('twas that their King betray'd,</l>
               <l>Which after they unto the <hi>Dragon</hi> paid</l>
               <l>Again) to thoſe who vow'd his Glory more</l>
               <l>Should be, than ever it was known before.</l>
               <l>But mark their mercy when they had him bought,</l>
               <l>'Twas nothing but his precious bloud they ſought,</l>
               <l>Who without Law, by Will was only try'd,</l>
               <l>And (though a <hi>Lyon</hi>) like a <hi>Lamb</hi> he dy'd.</l>
               <l>The <hi>Lyoneſs</hi> and <hi>Lyons</hi> young, all fled</l>
               <l>For fear, becauſe the <hi>Dragon</hi> baniſhed</l>
               <l>His Royal Iſſue; where they in exile</l>
               <l>Did live in grief and ſorrow for a while,</l>
               <l>Till that Old <hi>Dagon</hi>'s Image down did fall,</l>
               <l>Whoſe Tyranny did make his Subjects all</l>
               <l>Lament the <hi>Lyons</hi> loſſe, at which they ſent</l>
               <l>Out Orders for the <hi>Lyons</hi> Parlament,</l>
               <l>Who by a faithful General, did bring</l>
               <l>The <hi>Lyon</hi> home again to be their King,</l>
               <l>He ſoon did ſet the pretty <hi>Lambkins</hi> free,</l>
               <l>Both from the ſlaughter, and the Tyrany</l>
               <l>Of that curſt Council, who once did deny all</l>
               <l>The Noble Council, King, and Iſſue Royal.</l>
               <l>Then all the ſubtle <hi>Dragons</hi> curſed crew,</l>
               <l>For ſhelter into ev'ry corner flew,</l>
               <l>Some got away, ſome taken were and try'd,</l>
               <l>For Treaſon, and as Traytors, ſo they dy'd.</l>
               <l>Since which the <hi>Lyon</hi> young doth Reign, God ſend</l>
               <l>Him long to Live in Peace, and ſo I END.</l>
